# for class and object
# The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.
# (similar to 'this' in java/js)  and only used within the class definition

# static and class method, more at : https://realpython.com/instance-class-and-static-methods-demystified/
# We generally use class method to create factory methods. Factory methods return class objects ( similar to a constructor ) for different use cases., We generally use static methods to create utility functions.
'''@staticmethod : 
A static method is also a method that is bound to the class and not the object of the class.
A static method canâ€™t access or modify the class state.

'''@classmethod
A class method is a method that is bound to the class and not the object of the class.
They have the access to the state of the class as it takes a class parameter that points to the class and not the object instance.
It can modify a class state that would apply across all the instances of the class. For example, it can modify a class variable that will be applicable to all the instance
