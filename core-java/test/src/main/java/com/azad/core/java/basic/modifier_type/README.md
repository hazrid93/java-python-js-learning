Modifiers are keywords that you add to those definitions to change their meanings. Java language has a wide variety of modifiers, including the following −

> Java Access Modifiers

Java provides a number of access modifiers to set access levels for classes, variables, methods and constructors. The four access levels are −

> Visible to the package, the default. No modifiers are needed.

> Visible to the class only (private).

> Visible to the world (public).

> Visible to the package and all subclasses (protected).

### Non-Access Modifiers
Java provides a number of non-access modifiers to achieve many other functionality.

> The static modifier for creating class methods and variables.

> The final modifier for finalizing the implementations of classes, methods, and variables.

> The abstract modifier for creating abstract classes and methods.
