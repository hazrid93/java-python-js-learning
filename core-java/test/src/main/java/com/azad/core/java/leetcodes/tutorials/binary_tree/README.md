# Binary tree type

## Pre-order Traversal
Pre-order traversal is to visit the root first. Then traverse the left subtree. Finally, traverse the right subtree. Here is an example:

## In-order Traversal
In-order traversal is to traverse the left subtree first. Then visit the root. Finally, traverse the right subtree.

## Post-order Traversal
Post-order traversal is to traverse the left subtree first. Then traverse the right subtree. Finally, visit the root.
