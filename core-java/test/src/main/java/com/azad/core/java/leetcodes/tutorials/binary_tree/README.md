# Binary tree type

# Type of techniques
- DFS (preorder,inorder,postorder)
- BFS (by level)

Note: tree are like graph but restricted, tree doesnt require array to track visited
node like graph

# Depth First Search techniques (DFS)
## Pre-order Traversal
Pre-order traversal is to visit the root first. Then traverse the left subtree. Finally, traverse the right subtree. Here is an example:

## In-order Traversal
In-order traversal is to traverse the left subtree first. Then visit the root. Finally, traverse the right subtree.

## Post-order Traversal
Post-order traversal is to traverse the left subtree first. Then traverse the right subtree. Finally, visit the root.
